<h3 align="center">Cloud | Security | GRC | Mom in Tech | NPower AWS Cloud Practitioner Cohort 2026</h3>


## <span style="color:#800080;">💜 About Me</span>
I’m an IT and Information Security professional with a background in compliance, identity governance, access management, and cloud compliance risk assessments. After being laid off from Mastercard in January 2024, I stepped into a full-time caregiving role, which shifted my career path in an unexpected, but meaningful way. 

After nearly two years away from the industry, I recognized a clear skills gap and made the decision to return to tech with updated skills, hands-on cloud training, and a fresh mindset. Starting in January 2026, I will be rebuilding my technical foundation through the NPower AWS Cloud Practitioner Cohort and documenting my cloud journey, projects, and progress publicly.

I am passionate about cloud security, identity and access, and helping organizations maintain secure, compliant, least-privilege environments.

## 💼 My Experience
### 👮‍♀️ <span style="color:#9932CC;">Law Enforcement – Police Report Clerk</span>  
My career began in law enforcement as a Police Report Clerk, where I developed strong attention to detail, accuracy under pressure, and the ability to deescalate and communicate with individuals in high-stress situations. This role sharpened my investigative mindset, which later became invaluable in IT security, auditing, and access governance.

### 🖥️ <span style="color:#8A2BE2;">Technical Support & Help Desk</span>  
I transitioned into IT by supporting end users, troubleshooting technical issues, managing accounts, and assisting with software/system access. This experience built my foundation for IT operations, customer service, problem-solving, and understanding system behaviors from the ground up.

### 🔐 <span style="color:#BA55D3;">IAM Analyst – Identity & Access Management</span>  
As an IAM Analyst, I specialized in user lifecycle management and access reviews, focusing on enforcing least-privilege principles across multiple business applications. I performed:  
- User access provisioning & deprovisioning  
- Quarterly and annual access certifications  
- Entitlement reviews  
- SaaS/GRC documentation  
- Privilege management workflows  
This role strengthened my understanding of security controls, compliance frameworks, and organizational risk.

### ☁️ <span style="color:#9400D3;">Cloud Specialist – Cloud Application Risk & Compliance</span>  
As a Cloud Specialist, I worked as a Cloud Compliance/Cloud Risk Specialist, where I reviewed cloud application onboarding requests and assessed cloud services for security, governance, and policy alignment. My responsibilities included:  
- Cloud application risk assessments  
- Security control evaluations    
- Ensuring adherence to cloud compliance policies  
- Supporting audit responses and internal controls  
This experience expanded my knowledge of cloud services, SaaS security, and cloud governance while deepening my passion for cloud security and compliance.


<p style="color:#7F00FF;">Every role in my journey — from law enforcement to IAM to cloud security — has shaped the analytical, security-focused mindset I now bring into cloud computing and GRC.</p>
